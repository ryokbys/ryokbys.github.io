Upgraded macOS from Catalina to Big Sur today. So far almost no trouble occured after this OS upgrade except that there is an error when I tried to compile some program with using gfortran such as,
```bash
clang: error: invalid version number in '-mmacosx-version-min=11.0'
```

But this was solved by updating Xcode via App Store.

I prefer the appearance of Big Sur to Catalina ;)
