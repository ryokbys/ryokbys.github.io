# On jupyter notebook

This is done on jupyter notebook, and it can be read via nbviewer web
service. See the link below:

# How to put your jupyter notebook on the web?

When you make a jupyter notebook, put it at somewhere public place like
`Dropbox/Public/`. And get the URL of the file and put it in the search
box at [jupyter nbviewer website](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). Then
you get the URL of nbviewer page of your notebook.

Or you can just put `nbviewer.ipython.org/urls` after the `http://` of
your notebook URL, such as, :

    http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7875490/ipynbs/160114_ase_prepare_vasp.ipynb
